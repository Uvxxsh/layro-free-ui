## What is Layro?

Layro is a React and Tailwind UI library built for developers creating modern products with AI coding tools.

Instead of starting every product screen from scratch, Layro provides production-ready components designed around real product workflows, states, accessibility, and responsive behavior.

## Getting started

Each component is a single self-contained `.tsx` file. Copy the ones you want into your project (for example `components/ui/`). Chat Message, Prompt Input, Streaming Response, Message Actions, Data Table, Dialog and Auth Forms import `./button`, so copy `button.tsx` next to them. AI Chat is built from the other AI components, so copy it together with `button.tsx`, `chat-message.tsx`, `streaming-response.tsx`, `thinking-state.tsx`, `message-actions.tsx` and `prompt-input.tsx`.

### 1. Install the dependencies

Every component needs React 18 or 19 and Tailwind CSS v4. Most also use:

```bash
npm i clsx tailwind-merge lucide-react framer-motion
```

A few need one more package:

| Component | Extra packages |
|---|---|
| Button | `@radix-ui/react-slot` |
| AI Chat | `@radix-ui/react-tooltip` |
| Charts | `recharts` |
| Data Table | `@tanstack/react-table` |
| Command Menu | `cmdk @radix-ui/react-dialog` |
| Dialog | `@radix-ui/react-dialog` |
| Auth Forms | `@radix-ui/react-checkbox @radix-ui/react-label input-otp` |

### 2. Add the theme

The components use the standard shadcn/ui colour variables (`background`, `card`, `foreground`, `muted`, `primary`, `border`, `ring`, `destructive`, `chart-1` to `chart-5`), so an existing shadcn/ui theme already covers most of them.

Copy [`styles/layro-free.css`](styles/layro-free.css) into your project and import it after Tailwind. It adds the success, warning and info colours, two shadows, and the animations for dialogs, menus and the AI components:

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
@import "./styles/layro-free.css";
```

Light and dark mode follow the `.dark` class, the same as shadcn/ui.

## Quick example

```tsx
import { AIChat } from "@/components/ui/ai-chat";

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <AIChat
      assistant={{ name: "Assistant" }}
      welcome={{ title: "How can I help?", starters: ["Summarise this week's sales"] }}
      // Omit onSend to try it with the built-in simulator.
      onSend={async function* ({ messages, signal }) {
        const res = await fetch("/api/chat", { method: "POST", body: JSON.stringify({ messages }), signal });
        for await (const chunk of res.body!.pipeThrough(new TextDecoderStream())) yield chunk;
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

## Why Layro?

Layro components are designed around real product requirements rather than isolated visual examples.

Components include practical states and interactions such as:

- Loading and empty states
- Error and validation states
- Responsive behavior
- Keyboard interactions
- Accessible patterns
- Light and dark interfaces
- Real product workflows

The goal is simple: help developers move from an idea to a working product faster.

## React + Tailwind

Layro is built for modern React applications and uses Tailwind CSS for styling.

The components are designed to work well in:

- AI applications
- SaaS products
- Admin dashboards
- Analytics products
- Developer tools
- Internal tools
- Modern web applications
